 "Betrayal"
 "Long ago, a terrible act was committed. We may never know why or who betrayed first. But we know there were two betrayals."

 "Vengeance"
 "Oh, how sweet vengeance is. Rage, sweeping everything aside. Not even steel can halt the torrent of emotions of such power. There is no reason to stop."

 "Village"
 "There's no place for a peaceful life when fury is at stake. No one dare pretend everything's fine when we suffer. Let all know there will be no forgiveness. Not a soul."

 "Stronghold"
 "You can't hide even in a bunker. Run to the castle - the castle will fall. Run to the mountains - we will turn them into deep seas. Run far, but no distance will save you."

 "Outcome"
 "We all go until the end. Just like you. And we will stay with you until the end, even if the end is ours."
